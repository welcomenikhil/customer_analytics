## Project Description
Companies are always trying to find ways to boost e-commerce sales by personalizing their marketing strategies to drive customer retention. In this project, a recommendation engine will be built using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and cluster analysis to optimize customer lifetime value. The dataset that will be used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This transactional dataset contains transactions occurring between December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011, for an online retailer. Raw data includes 541,909 observations with 8 variables. The dataset includes 25,900 unique transactions with 3,958 unique products purchased by 4,372 different customers from 38 different countries.
